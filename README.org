#+TITLE: Informatica @ DSS 2019/2020

This is the  source code for the webpage of  the course of Informatica
(year 2019/2020) for the second trunk of students at the [[http://www.dss.uniroma1.it][Department  of Statistical
Sciences]] , currently published at

http://www.massimolauria.net/courses/informatica2019/

The idea  is that the site  is a bunch of  =org-mode= files, converted
into  a proper  webpage with  some  =org-publish= magic.  The site  is
uploaded using =rsync=.
